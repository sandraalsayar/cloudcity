# cloudcity

CloudCity is a Unity3D video game created by a team of 3 women who love making games.
The game is a cute low-poly aesthetic with a mixture of 2D & 3D style.

Storyline:

One morning, a star fell down from the sky and landed in Cloud City. Pieces of its crown broke and became scattered in Cloud City.
It needs to fly back up to its place in the constellation in the sky before night falls, or the the rest of the constellation that it belonged to comes crashing down.
In order to go back home, the star needs to retrieve its crown fragments, shaped like little stars, scattered through Cloud City, while going on mini quests.

Characters:

Main Character: A fallen star.
NPCs: sheep (citizens of Cloud City).

Setting:

A floating city in the clouds.

Rules/Objectives:

Find missing pieces of the broken star.
Interact with npcs and objects in the environment (rocks, plants, trees).
Do so before nighttime (time runs out).
